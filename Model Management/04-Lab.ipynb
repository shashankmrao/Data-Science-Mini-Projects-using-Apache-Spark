the `latitude` and `longitude` columns are very similar (up to tenth place) since all the Airbnb listings are in San Francisco. The Airbnb pricing probably will not vary too much between longitude and latitude differences of 0.0001 so we can facilitate the splitting factors of our tree by rounding the `latitude` and `longitude` values to the nearest hundredth instead of worrying about all 6 digits after the decimal point.

The `rf2` model is expecting to have `review_scores_sum` as an input column as well. Even if `X_test` had the same number of columns as the processed data we trained on, the line above will still error since it does not have our custom truncated `trunc_lat` and `trunc_long` columns.\n\nTo fix this, we could manually re-apply the same pre-processing logic to the `X_test` set each time we wish to use our model. \n\nHowever, there is a cleaner and more streamlined way to account for our pre-processing steps. We can define a custom model class that automatically pre-processes the raw input it receives before passing that input into the trained model's `.predict()` function. This way, in future applications of our model, we will no longer have to worry about remembering to pre-process every batch of data beforehand.\n\nComplete the `preprocess_input(self, model_input)` helper function of the custom `RF_with_preprocess` class so that the random forest model is always predicting off of a DataFrame with the correct column names and the appropriate number of columns."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TODO\n# Define the model class\nclass RF_with_preprocess(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\n\n    def __init__(self, trained_rf):\n        self.rf = trained_rf\n\n    def preprocess_input(self, model_input):\n        '''return pre-processed model_input'''\n        X_test_processed = model_input\n        X_test_processed[\"trunc_lat\"] = round(X_test_processed[\"latitude\"],2)\n        X_test_processed[\"trunc_long\"] = round(X_test_processed[\"longitude\"],2)\n        X_test_processed[\"review_scores_sum\"] = X_test_processed['review_scores_accuracy']+X_test_processed['review_scores_cleanliness']+                         X_test_processed['review_scores_checkin']+ X_test_processed['review_scores_communication']+ X_test_processed['review_scores_location']+ X_test_processed['review_scores_value']\n        X_test_processed = X_test_processed.drop([\"latitude\",\"longitude\",'review_scores_accuracy', 'review_scores_cleanliness', 'review_scores_checkin', 'review_scores_communication','review_scores_location','review_scores_value'], axis=1)\n        return X_test_processed \n    \n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\n        processed_model_input = self.preprocess_input(model_input.copy())\n        return self.rf.predict(processed_model_input)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let's save, then load this custom model's `python_function`."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Construct and save the model\nmodel_path =  userhome + \"/ml-production/RF_with_preprocess/\"\ndbutils.fs.rm(model_path, True) # remove folder if already exists\n\nrf_preprocess_model = RF_with_preprocess(trained_rf = rf2)\nmlflow.pyfunc.save_model(path=model_path.replace(\"dbfs:\", \"/dbfs\"), python_model=rf_preprocess_model)\n\n# Load the model in `python_function` format\nloaded_preprocess_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_pyfunc(model_path.replace(\"dbfs:\", \"/dbfs\"))"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">/local_disk0/tmp/1586394523934-0/PythonShell.py:9: DeprecationWarning: ..
